# Chaincraft:

[See Medium Article]()

Chaincraft is a node project that allows for the creation and updating of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) on the Algorand blockchain. With its web-based interface and CLI, both non-developers and developers can easily create assets and interact with the Algorand network.

## Chaincraft Web

The Chaincraft web allows non-developers to create assets through a dashboard, simply by signing into their Chaincraft wallet (powered by Morty wallet). The user-friendly interface makes it easy for anyone to create NFTs on the Algorand blockchain.

## Support for ARC3 and ARC69

Chaincraft supports both ARC3 and ARC69 asset standards in Algorand. The ARC3 asset URL leads to the metadata, which is pinned on IPFS, while the ARC69 assets URL leads to the media file, also pinned on IPFS. The ARC69 standard contains a manager's address, which allows for mutability of asset standards in Algorand.

## Limitations

Please note that the first version of Chaincraft is built to support media or NFTs of image mimetypes (png, jpeg, etc). The development team is working on adding support for other file types in future releases.
